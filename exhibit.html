            Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition, ‘The
            Sky
          </p>
          <p>
            Above Us’, explores the night sky and what we can see and know about

          <p>universe around us.</p>
          <p>
            We’ll locate the various constellations and galaxies that can be
            seen and
          </p>
          <p>
            learn a bit about the early navigators who used the stars to travel
            by.

        <section class="text">
          <p>
            For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the
            question
          </p>
          <p>of our origins. Where do we come from and how did we get here?</p>
          <p>
            Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a
            framework
          </p>
          <p>for exploring and understanding our place in this world.</p>
          <p>
            Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we
            know
          </p>
          <p>today have evolved our time.</p>
          <p>
            You can also take some time to meet a few of the creatures who
            didn’t
          </p>
          <p>
            survive, including our Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of

          <p>dinosaurs too.</p>

            From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in
            biology
          </p>
          <p>
            are offering us unique insights into the great wonders of the tiny
            world.
          </p>
          <p>
            For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their
            quality of life
          </p>
          <p>
            much improved, thanks to the growth of our understanding of
            medicine.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over a series of exhibits we explore the history of medicine and
            take a look
          </p>
          <p>
            at some major breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin
            and the
          </p>
          <p>first heart transplant.</p>
          <p>
            Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the
            lab,
          </p>
          <p>
            but also from observing animals in the wild. Often our fellow
