        <h2>Cosmology</h2>
        <p>Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition, ‘The Sky </p>
        <p>Above Us’, explores the night sky and what we can see and know about the</p>
        <p>universe around us.</p>
        <p>We’ll locate the various constellations and galaxies that can be seen and</p>
        <p>learn a bit about the early navigators who used the stars to travel by.</p>
        <p>Follow the journey of our solar exploration: from early Arab traders, to </p>
        <p>Galileo’s telescope, to the latest exploration of the planets in our solar </p>
        <p>system.</p>

      <section class="evolution">
        <h2>Evolution</h2>
        <p>For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the question</p>
        <p>of our origins. Where do we come from and how did we get here?</p>
        <p>Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a framework </p>
        <p>for exploring and understanding our place in this world.</p>
        <p>Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we know</p>
        <p>today have evolved our time.</p>
        <p>You can also take some time to meet a few of the creatures who didn’t</p>
        <p>survive, including our Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of </p>
        <p>dinosaurs too.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="robots_ai">
        <h2>Robotics and AI</h2>
        <p>The information revolution is here and robotics and artificial intelligence are</p>
        <p>the science of the future.</p>
        <p>From useful home applications of AI to industrial uses of robotics, the</p>
        <p>future is here. You can even say hello and shake the hand of Rob the Robot.</p>
      </section>

      
      <section class="Ecology">
        <h2>Ecology</h2>
        <p>As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the planet,</p>
        <p>the more important it becomes that scientists explore how to create a </p>
        <p>sustainable future not just for humans but for the whole planet.</p>

      <section class="biology_medicine">
        <h2>Biology and Medicine</h2>
        <p>From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in biology </p>
        <p>are offering us unique insights into the great wonders of the tiny world.</p>
        <p>For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their quality of life </p>
        <p>much improved, thanks to the growth of our understanding of medicine.</p>
        <p>Over a series of exhibits we explore the history of medicine and take a look</p>
        <p>at some major breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin and the</p>
        <p>first heart transplant.</p>
        <p>Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the lab, </p>
        <p>but also from observing animals in the wild. Often our fellow creatures have</p>
        <p>beat us to it.</p>
